Readers Note:

1. Source code has been tested and verified in VS 2005 RC IDE
on 1st November 2005 (see exception in note 4).
2. To run a project, set it as the 'start up project'. By default
the MVC project has been set as the 'start up project'.
3. To run a project and view the results in the console, hold down
the Ctrl and F5 keyboard buttons.
4. The ProxyRemoteClient and ProxyRemoteServer projects are
designed to run on the command line(See Appendix A). 
The files have been stored in this solution, and have not been
tested using the command line in VS 2005 (It was 
not available in VS 2005 RC - which was used to
code the projects). If you have difficulty running those projects
from within VS 2005, then follow the example in Appendix A and
use the command line. That example has been tested and verified.
5. If you have trouble with the code please review the errata
at apress.com, if there is no assistance there, then please
email errata@apress.com, or email the author(markhorner@hotmail.com).
